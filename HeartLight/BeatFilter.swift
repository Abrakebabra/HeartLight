/*
 Intended purpose:
 
 For perhaps smoothing?  Or provide a range of heart rates if it suddenly drops so it drops smoothly?
 
 Perhaps move the stress score calculator into this class from the Beat Modifier and keep it separate since it will be a more complex calculation
 
 Maybe stress score can be an internal measurement, and the class outputs an impact score to the lights.
